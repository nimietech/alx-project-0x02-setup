# Next.js Project Setup and Basics.

A foundational project built to demonstrate a strong understanding of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, focusing on clean architecture, reusable components, and modern frontend best practices. This project showcases the essential concepts required to build scalable, production-ready applications using the Next.js framework.

## 📌 Overview

This project is a structured walkthrough of the core fundamentals of Next.js. It highlights the ability to set up a modern development environment, create maintainable UI components, implement routing, interact with APIs, and follow clean project organization—skills expected from any strong frontend engineer.

The codebase reflects attention to detail, technical curiosity, and a clear effort to understand how real-world Next.js applications are built.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

    • Scaffold a Next.js application using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.nd CSS.
    
    • Implement routing using the Pages Router, including dynamic routes.
    
    • Build reusable and strongly-typed components using TypeScript interfaces.
    
    • Create interactive UI elements such as modals, buttons, and controlled components.
    
    • Fetch, handle, and display external API data using server-side and client-side approaches.
    
    • Organize a project following industry-standard folder structures and naming conventions.
    
    • Work with component state, props, and core React patterns.
    
    • Build responsive, accessible layouts with proper navigation structures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

• Next.js (Fundamentals, Pages Router, API routes)

• TypeScript (Type safety, interfaces, reusable types)

• Tailwind CSS (Utility-first responsive styling)


## 📕What This Project Demonstrates ?

• Ability to quickly learn and apply modern frontend frameworks

• Understanding of clean code, maintainability, and component reusability

• Strong foundation in TypeScript, an essential skill in professional teams

• Ability to structure a project in a way that scales as complexity grows

• Familiarity with core Next.js concepts used in real production applications

This serves as a solid baseline for more advanced concepts such as server actions, app router migration, authentication, caching, and backend integration.
